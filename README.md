Python for Reliability Engineering and Research
The area of Reliability Engineering and research involve several techniques and distribution parameters. Simultaneously reliability prediction using intelligent systems is gaining popularity. The conventional reliability techniques with distribution parameters are carried out using the reliability workbenches. Such reliability workbench plays a critical role in industries from reliable design to system repair and maintenance.

Industrial Reliability Workbench (IRW)
1.	The choice of IRW differs concerning the application.
2.	IRWs are expensive and vary concerning their packages or tools
3.	IRW with academic licenses is limited to periods and other constraints.
4.	Researchers and scientists lock forward to open-source software over IRW.

Why Python?
1.	Graphical User Interface (GUI) based open source software.
2.	Application Programming Interface (API) documented software.
3.	Mathematical distribution parameters for reliability prediction can be related.
4.	Inbuilt libraries support conventional techniques (Markov, Monte Carlo, etc.) 
5.	Also, support intelligent techniques (Neural Networks, Machine Learning, etc.)
6.	Found to be useful in the preliminary analysis of the system.
